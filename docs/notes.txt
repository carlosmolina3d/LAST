Class I think I need:
Creature, Crew, Ship, Location

Creature is controlled by the player or AI

Ship is a means of transportation

Location has a name, temperature, atmosphere

Event based game play.

Starts by asking the player if they want to play a new story, or generate their own crew.

If story mode is chosen the player is assigned a random name, job, and starting event.

If free mode is chosen the player picks their own crew, names, and starting point.
